## Making videos with `ari`: `ari_stitch`

The main workhorse of **`ari`** is the `ari_stitch` function.  This function 
requires an ordered set of images and an ordered set of audio 
objects, either paths to `wav` files or **`tuneR`** Wave objects, that correspond to each image. The `ari_stitch` function sequentially 
"stitches" each image in the video for the duration of its corresponding audio object using `ffmpeg`.  In order to use **`ari`**, one must
have an `ffmpeg` installation to combine the audio and images. Other packages such as **`animation`** have a similar requirement.  Moreover, on [shinyapps.io]( https://www.shinyapps.io/), a dependency on the **`animation`** 
package will trigger an installation of `ffmpeg` so **`ari`** 
can be used on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).  In the example below, 2 images (packaged with **`ari`**) are overlaid withe white noise for
demonstration.  This example also allows users to check if the output of `ffmpeg` works with a desired video player.

```{r stitch_run, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tuneR)
library(ari)
library(ariExtra)
if (ari::have_ffmpeg_exec()) {
  result = ari_stitch(
    ari_example(c("mab1.png", "mab2.png")),
    list(noise(), noise()))
  print(isTRUE(result))
}
```

The output is a logical indicator, but additional attributes are available, such as the path of the output file:

```{r stitch_out, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
if (ari::have_ffmpeg_exec()) {
  print(attributes(result)$outfile)
}
```

```{r stitch_out_run, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
if (ari::have_ffmpeg_exec()) {
  print(basename(attributes(result)$outfile))
}
```

The video for this output can be seen at https://youtu.be/3kgaYf-EV90.  

In **`ariExtra`**, you 
```{r stitch_extra, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tuneR)
library(ari)
library(ariExtra)
result = pngs_to_ari(ari_example(c("mab1.png", "mab2.png")),
                     script = c("hey", "ho"))
result
readLines(result$output_file)
```

## Synthesizer authentication

The above example uses `tuneR::noise()` to generate audio and to show that any audio object can be used with **`ari`**. 
In most cases however, **`ari`** 
is most useful when combined with synthesizing audio using a text-to-speech 
system. Though one can generate the spoken audio in many ways, such as 
fitting a custom deep learning model, we will focus on using the 
aforementioned services (e.g. Amazon Polly) as they have straightforward 
public web APIs. One obstacle in using such services is that users must 
go through steps to provide authentication, whereas most of these APIs 
and the associated R packages do not allow for interactive authentication 
such as OAuth.  

The **`text2speech`** package provides a unified interface to these 3
text-to-speech services, and we will focus on Amazon Polly and its authentication requirements.  Polly is authenticated using the **`aws.signature`** package.  The **`aws.signature`** documentation provides options and steps to create the relevant credentials; we have also provided an additional
[tutorial](http://seankross.com/2017/05/02/Access-Amazon-Web-Services-in-R.html).  Essentially, the user must sign up for the service and retrieve public and 
private API keys and put them into their R profile or other areas accessible to R. Running `text2speech::tts_auth(service = "amazon")` will indicate if 
authentication was successful (if using a different service, change the 
`service` argument). NB: The APIs are generally paid services, but many have 
free tiers or limits, such as Amazon Polly's free tier for the first year (https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/). 
<!-- NB - nota bene -->


## Creating Speech from Text: `ari_spin`

After Polly has been authenticated, videos can be created using the `ari_spin` function with an ordered set of images and a corresponding ordered set 
of text strings.  This text is the "script" that is spoken over the 
images to create the output video.  The number of elements in the text 
needs to be equal to the number of images. 


### Creating Videos from R Markdown Documents

Many R users have experience creating slide decks with R Markdown, for 
example using the **`rmarkdown`** or 
**`xaringan`** packages.  In **`ari`**, the HTML slides 
are rendered using **`webshot`** and the script is located 
in HTML comments (i.e. between `<!--` and `-->`).  For example, in the 
file `ari_comments.Rmd` included in **`ari`**, which is an `ioslides` type of R Markdown slide 
deck, we have the last slide:

```{r}
x = readLines(ari_example("ari_comments.Rmd"))
tail(x[ x != ""], 4)
```



so that the first words spoken on that slide are `"Thank you"`. This setup 
allows for one plain text, version-controllable, integrated document that 
can reproducibly generate a video.  We believe these features allow creators 
to make agile videos, that can easily be updated with new material or changed 
when errors or typos are found.  Moreover, this framework provides an opportunity to translate videos into multiple languages, we will discuss in the future directions.  


```{r narr_show, eval = FALSE}
# Create a video from an R Markdown file with comments and slides
result = ariExtra::rmd_to_ari(
  ari::ari_example("ari_comments.Rmd"),
  capture_method = "iterative", open = FALSE)
```



The output video is located at https://youtu.be/rv9fg_qsqc0. In our 
experience with several users we have found that some HTML slides take 
more or less time to render when using **`webshot`**; for example they may 
be tinted with gray because they are in the middle of a slide transition when 
the image of the slide is captured.  Therefore we provide the `delay` argument 
in `ari_narrate` which is passed to **`webshot`**. This can resolve these 
issues by allowing more time for the page to fully render, however this 
means it may take for more time to create each video.  We also provide 
the argument `capture_method`  to allow for finely-tuned control of 
`webshot`. When `capture_method = "vectorized"`, **`webshot`** is 
run on the entire slide deck in a faster process, however we have 
experienced slide rendering issues with this setting depending on the 
configuration of an individual's computer. However when 
`capture_method = "iterative"`, each slide is rendered individually 
in `webshot`, which solves many rendering issues, however it causes 
videos to be rendered more slowly.  
In the future, other HTML headless rendering engines (`webshot` uses `PhantomJS`) may be used if they achieve better performance, but we have found **`webshot`** to work well in most of our applications.

With respect to accessibility, **`ari`** encourages video creators to 
type out a script by design. This provides an effortless source of subtitles 
for people with hearing loss rather than relying on other services, such as
YouTube, to provide speech-to-text subtitles.  When using `ari_spin`, if the
`subtitles` argument is `TRUE`, then an SRT file for subtitles will be created 
with the video.

One issue with synthesis of technical information is that changes to the script 
are required for Amazon Polly or other services to provide a correct 
pronunciation.  For example, if you want the service to say "RStudio" or 
"`ggplot2`", the phrases "R Studio" or "g g plot 2" must be written exactly 
that way in the script. These phrases will then appear in an SRT subtitle 
file, which may be confusing to a viewer.  Thus, some post-processing of the SRT file may be needed. 

### Creating Videos from Other Documents

In order to create a video from a Google Slide deck or PowerPoint 
presentation, the slides should be converted to a set of images. We 
recommend using the PNG format for these images.  In order to get the 
script for the video, we suggest putting the script for each slide in 
the speaker notes section of that slide. Several of the following features 
for video generation are in our package **`ariExtra`**
(https://github.com/muschellij2/ariExtra).  The speaker notes of slides can 
be extracted using **`rgoogleslides`**  for Google 
Slides via the API or using **`readOffice`**/**`officer`** 
to read from PowerPoint documents. Google Slides can be downloaded as a PDF and converted to PNGs using the **`pdftools`** 
package.  The **`ariExtra`** package also has a `pptx_notes` 
function for reading PowerPoint notes. Converting PowerPoint files to 
PDF can be done using LibreOffice and the **`docxtractr`** package which contains the necessary wrapper functions.

To demonstrate this, we use an example PowerPoint is located on Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/Example_PowerPoint_for_ari/8865230).  We can convert the PowerPoint to PDF, then to a set of PNG images, then extract the speaker notes.

```{r pptx_convert}
have_libreoffice = function() {
  x = try({docxtractr:::lo_assert()}, silent = TRUE)
  !inherits(x, "try-error")
}
if (have_libreoffice()) {
  pptx = tempfile(fileext = ".pptx")
  download.file(
    paste0("https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/", 
           "pfigshare-u-files/16252631/ari.pptx"),
    destfile = pptx)
  result = try({
    pptx_to_ari(pptx, open = FALSE)
  }, silent = TRUE)
  soffice_config_issue = inherits(result, "try-error")
  if (soffice_config_issue) {
    ariExtra:::fix_soffice_library_path()
    result = try({
      pptx_to_ari(pptx, open = FALSE)
    }, silent = TRUE)    
  }
  if (!inherits(result, "try-error")) {
    print(result[c("images", "script")])
  }
}
```

This can be passed to `ari_spin`. 

For Google Slides, the slide deck can be downloaded as a PowerPoint and the
previous steps can be used, however it can also be downloaded directly as 
a PDF. We will use the same presentation, but uploaded to Google Slides. The **ariExtra** package has the function `gs_to_ari` to wrap this functionality (as long as link sharing is turned on), where we can pass the Google identifier:

```{r, message=FALSE}
gs_doc = ariExtra::gs_to_ari("14gd2DiOCVKRNpFfLrryrGG7D3S8pu9aZ")
gs_doc[c("images", "script")]
```

Note, as Google provides a PDF version of the slides, this obviates the LibreOffice dependency.

Alternatively, the notes can be extracted using
**`rgoogleslides`** and for Google Slides via the API, but requires authentication, so we will omit it here.  Thus, we should be able to create 
videos using R Markdown, Google Slides, or PowerPoint presentations in an 
automatic fashion.
